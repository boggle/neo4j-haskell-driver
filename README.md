neoj-haskell-driver
===================

This is a Neo4j Haskell driver for connecting to the Neo4j graph database using the Bolt protocol.

This repository is experimental, the driver is incomplete and still in development, and doesn't work with any officially released version of Neo4j.
The driver is targeted to work with a (yet to be released) future version of Neoj4.

In other words: this is pre-alpha code, please move on.
